            <p>Hello everyone, I'm Scott Vinkle.</p>
            <p>I'm a front end developer and accessibility advocate at Shopify.</p>
            <p>During this workshop we'll be covering quite a few different topics. All of which will be focused on usability, accessibility, and inclusive thinking in design and development.</p>
            <p>Essentially what we'll be discussing is common accessibility issues found in design and development, how they affect different user groups, and ways to overcome the barriers introduced for people with disabilities.</p>
            <p>We'll also be fixing up a small blog website that is ripe full of accessibility issues! Throughout the day we'll be looking at various issues and ways to make sure the site is accessible and inclusive for everyone!</p>

          <h2>What is accessibility?</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When we speak about accessibility on the web we're talking about making sure our apps and web sites that we create are understandable and usable by people with disabilities.</p>
            <p>Making something accessible does not only involve the code behind the app or site, but <em>a lot</em> of what we design visually and the user experience we determine and set in place for our users plays a very large part in the accessibility of our products.</p>

          <h3>Mindfulness is key</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Poor connection speed — Performance</li>
            <li>Handheld device — Responsive design</li>
            <li>Person with disability — Accessibility</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Consider this: When you’re driving a car, it’s crucial to pay attention to your surroundings. To be a successful driver, you must take into account other drivers, cyclists, road signs, and pedestrians. Without this consideration for others, you face the potential of getting into trouble quite quickly.</p>
            <p>Along the same lines, as designers and developers, when you are mindful of people and the various ways they use and interact with your website you help ensure a positive user experience for all.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If you consider someone in a remote area of the world with a poor connection speed, you’ll make sure the site and all its assets will load quickly and perform optimally</li>
              <li>If you consider someone doing research and learning about a topic using a handheld device, you’ll be sure to design a user interface that supports a wide range of device screen sizes and orientations</li>
              <li>If you consider someone who is blind, hard of hearing, motor impairments, or who has difficulty understanding written text on a page, then you’ll code and structure content in a way that will help convey meaning and purpose for people who use and depend on assistive technology to experience the web.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What really happens is that as you start thinking of and developing for people with disabilities, you end up actually improving the usability of a site for all users.</p>

            <p>A visual impairment is anything that affects a person's ability to see clearly. In other words, if you don't have perfect 20/20 vision, you are considered to have a visual impairment.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Does anyone here use any assistive technology to help with their vision? <em>(Glasses are assistive tech!)</em></p>
            <p>Some impairments can easily be corrected by simply wearing a pair of glasses or inserting contact lenses. Other impairments are more permanent, such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Low vision</strong></p>
                <p>Difficulty seeing things clearly, which is common among the elderly, or due to genetics, traumatic injuries, or illnesses</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Color blindness</strong></p>
                <p>Which means some folks cannot perceive (see) the difference between certain color combinations</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Legally blind</strong></p>
                <p>Which doesn't necessarily mean someone can't see at all, but rather can only see light or vague shapes of objects</p>

            <p>It's important to note that the term <strong>Hearing Impaired</strong> is considered offensive to those in the community as many do not consider themselves as being impaired. Rather, the terms "deaf" and/or "hard of hearing" are considered

            <p>So far we've discussed many disabilities which can considered permanent. However, there is such a thing as a temporary disability. Perhaps you know someone or you yourself have been in a situation where you have limited abilities for a short
              term.
            </p>
            <p>Consider the following situations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A broken arm or finger which limits your ability to only use one arm/hand</li>
              <li>Trying to read text on your phone while outside in the sun—contrast!</li>
              <li>A loud, busy area such as a bus terminal or train station might limit your cognitive thought process</li>
              <li>Having Lasik eye surgery limits your vision for a period of time</li>
              <li>Traveling to a new country and not understanding the local spoken language or street signs</li>
              <li>Holding a baby in one arm while trying to look something up on your phone with the other!</li>

            <p>The point here is that, temporary or permanent, designing with accessibility in mind really helps everyone in any type of situation.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>One of the most basic aids to help people navigate an app with ease and confidence (and is baked in to every site by default) is the focus indicator.</p>
            <p>What is the focus indicator? It's the visual indicator of where you currently are on a page when navigating by keyboard alone.</p>
            <p>Load up your favorite site and start pressing the Tab key. Is there any indication of where the cursor currently is on the page? If you're in Chrome or Safari the default indicator is a blue outline, where Firefox and Internet Explorer/Edge features a dashed black outline.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>For people with <strong>motor disabilities</strong> or any other impairment (temporary or permanent) which prevents use of the mouse, navigating with the keyboard is the next best option.</p>
            <p>Additionally, those who consider themselves “power users” who prefer the keyboard over using the mouse, such as filling out long forms, will also greatly benefit.</p>
            <p>When you use the Tab key on a site, the keyboard cursor will appear, typically a blue ring or black dotted line depending on the browser, and  move from one HTML element to the next. Using Shift + Tab moves the keyboard cursor backward through the page. The elements highlighted are considered to be “naturally” focusable.  Elements such as links, buttons, form inputs, etc all receive keyboard focus by default and should highlight when the cursor moves from one to the next.</p>

            <p>Sometimes during the design or development of a project, the request is made to remove the focus indicator ring.

            <p>Using CSS it is possible to create your own focus indicator. With a bit of code such as…</p>
            <p><em>(The code on the screen…)</em></p>
            <p>…you can create a custom focus indicator. This places a solid red outline around focusable elements.</p>
            <p>When implementing a custom outline, there are a couple things to keep in mind:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ensure the contrast ratio of the indicator against the background is high. If people can't see the focus indicator the its purpose is lost.</li>
              <li>Make it consistent. Since a custom focus indicator will be unexpected on first visit, it's a good idea to keep things consistent and predictable throughout the user experience of the site.</li>

            <p>There's been lots of great work done recently on detecting when someone's using a mouse or a keyboard to navigate site content. In doing so, designers are able to create a custom, highly visible focus indicator for keyboard users only. Mouse
              users would be free to rely on only the mouse cursor as their indicator.</p>
            <p>This technique is not yet built directly into browsers. However, there are third-party code snippets (also called a "polyfill") available to gain this functionality.</p>

            <p>If you’re familiar with CSS flexbox or grid, you might know that it’s very easy to manipulate the order of content using only CSS. If you need to move a right bar container to the left side of the screen, it’s as easy as adding one line of CSS.</p>
            <p>The issue here is when someone is using the keyboard, screen reader, or any input that’s not a mouse, the focus indicator may jump around the screen unexpectedly. In moving the right bar container to the left via CSS, the HTML used to generate the page content remains in the same position. As a result, the keyboard focus order would move from top header bar to the main content container on the right, then back to the top left of the page, finally to the footer content.</p>

          <h3>Focus management</h3>
          <img src="images/focus-management.gif" width="700" height="471" alt="Animated GIF of a modal window opening on a webpage.">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Focus management is a method used to willfully and purposefully move the keyboard cursor from one element to another on behalf of the user. This technique should only be used when absolutely necessary as to not create more work for the user when an unexpected shift in focus has occurred.</p>
            <p>An example of default focus management that we get from the browser for free is when we activate the Tab key in a form field, focus is automatically sent to the next field in the set. Or, when moving from link to link, focus moves from the top of the document to the bottom. When using native elements, the browser takes care of moving and managing focus position for us.</p>
            <p>However, when it comes to creating a non-native control or widget, such as a modal window which we’ll look at in greater depth later, we need to manage the focus position on behalf of the user.</p>
            <p>How we accomplish this is by use of the tabindex attribute.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <blockquote>The <code>tabindex</code> attribute</blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The tabindex attribute can be applied to and HTML element in order to help manage focus, but should be restricted in its use to a few use cases. Let’s look at the different values we can assign this attribute and what the intention is behind each.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4><code>tabindex="-1"</code></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Allows <strong>non-focusable</strong> elements to <em>programmatically</em> receive focus via JavaScript</li>
            <li>Does <strong>not</strong> add the element to the natural focus order</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The value tabindex=”-1” allows a non-focusable element to programmatically receive focus via JavaScript, but does not add the element to the natural focus order. This means when someone is navigating by the Tab key, any element with a tabindex value of -1 will not recieve focus.</p>
            <p>For example, when opening a modal window, use JavaScript to apply the tabindex=”-1” attribute to the container, then call the containers focus() method to apply keyboard focus. This allows the user to Tab forward from this point.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4><code>tabindex="0"</code></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Allows <strong>non-focusable</strong> elements to receive focus</li>
            <li><strong>Adds</strong> the element to the natural focus order</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The value tabindex=”0” allows a non-focusable element to receive focus and includes the element within the natural focus order. With thism when someone is navigating by the Tab key, any element with a tabindex value of 0 will recieve focus.</p>
            <p>For example, if there was a need to attach a click event handler to something like a div element, applying tabindex=”0” would allow the div to receive keyboard focus when Tabbing through page content.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4><code>tabindex="1"</code> or higher</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Send focus to this element first, then focus returns to the next element</li>
            <li>Considered an <strong>anti-pattern</strong> and should be avoided</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Any tabindex value greater than 0 is considered an anti-pattern and should be avoided. For example, if an element featured tabindex=”5”, this would send focus to this element first when navigating through the page content, then, focus would return to the next element in the natural tab order.</p>
            <p>As previously discussed, the browser automatically handles focus management between natively focusable elements. With this in mind, let’s rely on the browser to handle focus as determined by the order of element within the document.</p>

          <blockquote>Refrain from adding <code>tabindex="0"</code> everywhere!</blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When it comes to navigating non-focusable elements, such as plain text content, headings, or images, it’s important to note that assistive technology, such as screen readers (which will be discussed in more detail later), have built-in functionality to read and consume these types of content pieces.</p>
            <p>After learning about using the Tab key to move around a UI and the tabindex attribute, you may be tempted to place tabindex=”0” on everything in order to ensure a screen reader user is able to Tab to these elements. Please refrain from doing so. This is considered an anti-pattern as this will cause more work for keyboard users to move around and consume the content they’re interest in.</p>
            <p>With some exceptions, only elements to receive the tabindex=”0” attribute would be those with an action applied, such as a JavaScript click event handler. Leave all other elements out of the natural tab order, otherwise, keyboard-only users would have to hit the Tab key many times just to reach links at the bottom of a page, cause a very frustrating user experience.</p>

            <p>Every HTML element serves a purpose. The purpose is conveyed through it’s semantic meaning. As a quick example, an link element’s semantic meaning is conveyed as, "link".

          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>There's information that needs to be present when an element receives keyboard focus in order for someone using a screen reader to navigate and consume that content.</p>
            <p>For example, naturally focusable elements include links, buttons, and other form controls, and when the element is in focus, its text content and related attributes are read out loud to screen reader users, describing what it is they're currently interacting with.</p>
            <p>What's actually announced is:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The element’s accessible name or text equivalent</li>
              <li>The element role</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The accessible name is the part that describes what the element is for, its purpose for being.</p>
            <p>This is usually found as the content between the start and end tags of an HTML element. It could also be the alternative text value for an image <code>alt</code> attribute, or the <code>label</code> associated with a form input.</p>
            <p>Let’s take for instance, a link. This element has text between its start and end tag. This text gets read aloud by a screen reader when it receives keyboard focus. In doing so, this conveys context on what should happen or where the browser should go when that link is activated.</p>
            <p>For example, a link in a navigation area with the accessible name of "Contact Us" would indicate that, if you activated that link, it would load a page with contact information, maybe a telephone number or address, and possibly a form where someone could send a message.</p>

          <img src="images/semantics-2.png" alt="Screen reader focus on a link. A speech bubble reads, 'Contact us, link'.">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The element’s role informs the user of a few things, including what the element does and how to interact with it. </p>
            <p>Coming back to the link example, the role announced when the link receives keyboard focus would be "link," as links are structured with opening and closing <code>a</code> tags and include a valid <code>href</code> attribute. The expected result or, "what it does," would be for the browser to either load a new page or jump to another section of the same page, shifting focus to a different element. How to interact with the link would be for the user to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key, as this is also a part of the sematics of a link.</p>
            <p>Various element roles come with expectations on how to use them. Depending on the role, a user might expect they would need to press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to continue (as is the case with a link), use the <kbd>Space</kbd> key to activate a button, or perhaps use the <kbd>Up-arrow</kbd> or <kbd>Down-arrow</kbd> keys to make a selection when interacting with a <code>select</code> element.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In addition to the name and role, depending on the element at hand, there could also be a state announcement.</p>
            <p>Announcing the state helps to convey the current condition of the element, whether interaction is needed, and what might happen when the interaction takes place.</p>
            <p>For example, checkboxes and radio buttons have a "checked" or "unchecked," and a "selected" or "unselected" state, respectively.</p>
            <p>An accordion style widget would have an "expanded" or "collapsed" state, indicating whether the content is on-screen and available for consumption (expanded), or if the content section will merely be skipped over when navigation continues (collapsed).</p>

            <p>Focus is shifted from one item to the next by using the Tab key, which moves the keyboard cursor to each focusable element.</p>

            <p>To start VoiceOver (VO), press the Cmd + F5 keys. VO will start reading the page or application you’re currently looking at. You can Cmd + F5 again to quit out of VO.</p>
            <p>Alternatively if you're on a Macbook with a TouchBar, you'll need to press Cmd + Pwr three times to start VO.</p>
            <p>Start NVDA by pressing Ctrl + Alt + N. Alternatively you can use the Windows Run dialog and enter, "nvda". One method to quit out of NVDA is to use the Run dialog again and enter "nvda -q".</p>

            <p>Most likely one of the most important keyboard command to know when testing is how to make the screen reader temporarily stop making announcements. This seems to be the only universal truth among screen reader vendors across varying operating systems.</p>
            <p>To pause either VO or NVDA (other screen readers, too), simply press the Ctrl key.</p>
            <p>When you start navigating again, the screen reader voice will come back to life, happily announcing the content that you’re currently interacting with.</p>

Moving around in this fashion is considered using the "browser cursor." The browser cursor moves focus around from one focusable element to the next.</p>
            <p>While this is quite handy for keyboard-only users, there is another cursor which can move to non-focusable items and describes the content on the page with greater detail, the "screen reader virtual cursor."</p>

          <h2>Page structure</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Setting in place a solid page structure and design for any site or app is key for building an accessible experience. Page structure consist of headings and landmark elements which help screen reader users understand the layout and content of the page at a high-level.</p>
            <p>When we speak about a "heading" we refer to the larger bits of text which denote a new section of content the page often found within body copy, not the "header" of the site, which typically consist of the logo and navigation, etc.</p>

          <blockquote>People who depend on assistive technology often navigate by headings first.</blockquote>
          <ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>It’s important that the code making up the heading structure is linear and is in a logical order. When someone who depends on assistive technology visits a new site or page that they’ve never been to before, they’ll often first navigate by headings to get a sense of the content being offered on the page. It’s the same idea as someone reading through the headings of a newspaper; gather the general idea of the content available, then visit the sections of interest.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Logical heading order is key</h3>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-html">
              &lt;h1&gt;Primary heading&lt;/h1&gt;
              &lt;!-- … --&gt;

              &lt;h2&gt;Sub-section&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;!-- … --&gt;

              &lt;h3&gt;Sub-sub-section&lt;/h3&gt;
              &lt;!-- … --&gt;

              &lt;h2&gt;Sub-section&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;!-- … --&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>For example, in your HTML you'd start with a single <code>h1</code> heading as the primary title of the page, followed by an <code>h2</code> heading for each major sub-section of content. If there were any sub-sub-sections, those would feature <code>h3</code> headings. When a section of content is complete, the heading would return to the appropriate level to start the new section.</p>
            <p>In addition to the HTML code behind the headings, the visual design of headings is also very important. Text sizes which go from large to medium to small denotes the content structure and related content. People with a <strong>cognitive impairment</strong> or <strong>reading/learning disability</strong> will greatly appreciate content being split into pieces with headings conveying the message that, "this is a new section of content." Without headings, large walls of content can be quite difficult for some people to consume and may even lead to a sense of overwhelm.</p>

            <p>Landmarks are the HTML elements which define the overall structure of a complete page. A typical web page might include sections such as a top bar with a heading logo, main navigation, a sidebar with more navigation or additional related content, a footer section, and of course the main body content. As a result, what we now have with HTML5 are specific elements which feature the semantic meaning for each section.</p>
            <p>At a high level, the landmark elements consist of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Header, with a role of banner, is typically the first landmark element in the DOM, containing the main logo, primary navigation, and sometimes a search form.</li>
              <li>Footer, with a role of contentinfo, is typically the last element in the DOM, containing links and copyright information.</li>
              <li>Aside, with a role of complimentary, it contains content relative to the article or the site in general.</li>
              <li>Nav, with a role of navigation, is used to denote navigation areas.</li>
              <li>Main, with a role of main, is the main content area of the page, typically found as a sibling to the header and footer.</li>
              <li>Section, the only landmark without an explicit role value, is a generic element used for sectioning off content such as portions of a page or article.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Just like with headings, people who use a screen reader are able to discover page content by navigating via landmark elements only. This allows people to quickly jump to different sections of the page without having to wade through content unrelated to their current task.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Alt text, or "alternative text" as the long-form name suggests, is a written text description for an image on the web. It helps to describe the image for the reader to understand what the image is about.</p>
            <p>In other words, alt text is content. And like any other content on your site, it should be well written and constructed, ready for consumption.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>There are a few situations where writing alt text and including well formed descriptions for your imagery is beneficial for a successful website, including search engine optimization and sighted users who are able to read the content when
              and if an image fails to load.</p>
            <p>However, it's actually people who use and rely on assistive technology who have the most to gain when interacting with non-text content on the web.</p>
            <p>Alt text provides people with visual impairments the ability to participate in consuming non-text content.</p>
            <p>When assistive technology, such as a screen reader, encounters an image on the web, the alt text is read and announced aloud. By
              doing so, someone who relies on this technology can still have a clear understanding of what the image represents and be included in the conversation.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When writing HTML code, it’s important to always include the alt attribute on an image element. Without this attribute, you risk running into some issues:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Without an alt attribute, your HTML markup is considered invalid and may result in an inconsistent user experience.</li>
              <li>When a screen reader encounters an img element without the alt attribute, the src attribute value is announced. This is often not helpful and can be regarded as a poor user experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With this in mind, whether you’re working with Wordpress, React, or plain HTML, remember to always include the alt attribute when including an image in code.</p>

          <h3>When to include alt text</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>If the image contains text, the <code>alt</code> value should be an exact match</li>
            <li>If the image doesn’t add any value, the <code>alt</code> attribute value should be left empty</li>
            <li>If the image adds content or value, add descriptive <code>alt</code> text</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>You might be tempted to always include some sort of text within the alt attribute in order to cater for the cases outlined above. However, the fact remains that not every image should have a value set for its alt attribute.</p>
            <p>How do we know when to include alt text for our images? Here are three common situations to consider if alt text should be added or if the alt attribute should be set as empty.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If the image itself contains text, such as a logo or an inspirational quote embedded within the image, the alt attribute value should be an exact match of the visible text.</li>
              <li>If the image doesn’t add any valuable content to the article, or is adjacent to related text content, the alt attribute value should be left empty. This results in screen readers bypassing the image altogether as it is considered a "decorative" image.</li>
              <li>If the image is considered to add content or value to the article, add descriptive alt text.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>How to write alt text</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Be accurate and descriptive</li>
            <li>Don't overwhelm with too much information</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Writing high quality, descriptive alt text may not be as easy as it seems. A quick one-liner of "Cat on couch," "white shoes," or "group of people," doesn’t quite do the trick of painting a mental picture.</p>
            <p>On the flip side, it is possible to overwhelm someone with too much descriptive text. Getting that fine line of descriptive precision is something of a skill master.</p>

            <p>This description is pretty accurate, but a little too wordy. Since we’re describing a product we can focus directly on the product’s physical features.</p>
            <p>Let’s cut the description back to just the essential, such as:</p>

            <p>"Dark blue, low-top shoes with white midsole, brown lace, black back tab, and white lining."</p>
            <p>This alt text does the trick; it describes the image in a clear and precise manner, not overwhelming someone as they take in the content. The general recommendation is to keep alt text to around 100 characters in order to hit that fine line of "just enough" content.</p>

          <h2>Links vs Buttons</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>A link has very different semantic meaning than a button element. When to use one or the other has been discussed and argued by many an accessibility developer. Much like the old debate of spaces vs tabs in code editors, people have their opinions. What it really comes down to is the context of which the control is being used.</p>
            <p>Let’s go over the basics in which people tend to agree on:</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Link and button expectations</h3>
          <table style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">Element</th>
                <th scope="col">Is announced as</th>
                <th scope="col">Is activated by</th>
                <th scope="col">Results in</th>
                <th scope="col">Shifts focus?</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>a</td>
                <td><em>"link"</em></td>
                <td><kbd>Enter</kbd></td>
                <td>Loading a new page, downloading a file, or jumping to a section on the same page.</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>button</td>
                <td><em>"button"</em></td>
                <td><kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd></td>
                <td>Submitting a form or executing an on-screen action (eg., sorting table columns.)</td>
                <td>No</td>
              </tr>

          </table>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>From this table, we’re able to recognize how each of these elements are announced, how someone would interact with them, and the expected result. This, in an essence, is what "semantic HTML" is all about.</p>
            <p>One key difference to recognize is the expectation of a shift in focus. Links typically either load a brand new page, resulting in a focus shift to the top of the document, or jump to somewhere else on the same page resulting in keyboard focus moving to that position.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, buttons do not shift focus. If a button is in use, the expectation would be for keyboard focus to remain on the button even after activation.</p>

          <h3>Control design</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>What is actually meant by, "control design?" This is referring to the look and feel of the focusable elements: in this case links and <code>button</code>s.</p>
            <p>In modern web design, it's not uncommon to see links which look like <code>button</code>s; text with a background color and rounded borders, or a solid outline and transparent background. It's slightly less common to see <code>button</code>s which look like links, but it does happen.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Control design and accessibility</h3>
          <img src="images/link-button.png" alt="An underlined link with the text, 'Link'. A button with the text, 'Button'.">
          <ul>
            <li>Consistent control design allows people to identify and use with confidence</li>
            <li>Voice dictation software accuracy</li>
            <li>Color alone may not be enough to perceive the control</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When it comes to accessibility best practices, the ideal design for each control would be something of a traditional look; colored text with an underline to denote a link and a solid background color with slightly rounded corners to denote a <code>button</code>.</p>
            <p>Why is it so critical to usability and accessibility for these elements to appear in this manner? Here's a few reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Having controls designed in a consistent manner allows people with a <strong>cognitive impairment</strong> to identify and use the control with confidence, that it will result in meeting their expectations.</li>
              <li>When someone with a <strong>motor disability</strong> relies on voice dictation software and they announce, "click Submit button" when really the <code>button</code> is actually a link element, their command will not work.</li>
              <li>When links are only distinguished by color alone, folks with <strong>color blindness</strong> or <strong>low-vision</strong> may not be able to perceive the link for a link and miss it completely.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With links designed like links and <code>button</code>s designed like <code>button</code>s, everyone will benefit from the clear indication of which is which and will be able to use the controls with confidence. The idea is to avoid activating something that they weren't expecting, causing them more work to undo the previous action.</p>
            <p>In other words, make sure things are clear, consistent, and obvious.</p>

          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The hover state comes into play when someone using a mouse hovers over an interactive element. Changing the visual aspect to something like a background color or an underline greatly helps to generate a visual cue that the element they're
              currently hovering on is interactive. It provides a sense of reassurance that this thing they're currently hovering over is indeed clickable.</p>

            <p>In addition to the hover and focus state, the active state is also available.</p>
            <p>The active state shows only when an element is currently being interacted with. For example, when someone clicks down on a link and then releases the mouse button, that in-between state is the active state.</p>
            <p>Including a unique active state style helps people with <strong>motor impairments</strong> or even <strong>dyslexia</strong> as when an item is interacted with, the active state serves as a confirmation and reassurance that the element was
              clicked.

          <h3>Notes on the <code>href</code> attribute</h3>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Sometimes when creating a web app it’s common to add a click event to a link element. Weather it should be an a is unknown without understanding the context of the task at hand. What is important, though, is that the link is always accompanied by its href attribute.</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>The missing <code>href</code></h4>
          <p><strong>Don't do this:</strong></p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-html">
              &lt;a onclick="doSomething()"&gt;Do something&lt;/a&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p><strong>Do this instead:</strong></p>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-html">
              &lt;a href="#doSomething" onclick="doSomething()"&gt;Do something&lt;/a&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>What happens when the href attribute is missing? The mouse click event works just fine, however without the href attribute, the link is no longer keyboard focusable.</p>
            <p>This is an issue for keyboard-only and screen reader users as they’d have no way to access the control. At this point, the element is essentially a fancy looking span with no semantic meaning. Always include the href attribute.</p>

          <h4>Including a unique <code>href</code> value</h4>
          <img src="images/href.png" alt="Screen reader with multiple speech bubbles of, 'link visited'.">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Just like how links have a visual unvisited and visited state (by default, blue links which turn purple post activation), screen readers also announce the visited state.</p>
            <p>Coming back to the web app example of using a link elements with a click event handler, it’s common to include the href attribute with the number or "hash tag" character (#). With the number character set as the href destination, focus would be brought back to the top of the document on click. However, with the custom JavaScript event attached, we don’t need to really worry about the destination, right?</p>
            <p>The problem here is that since the link (or potentially many links on the same page) have the same href value, activating one will set all the others as "visited." For someone using a screen reader, hearing "link, visited" when they in fact hadn’t yet visited the link can be a confusing experience.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The solution here is to always include a unique string along with the number character in the href value. This could be set to the id of the element which the link interacts with when it shifts keyboard focus, or a randomly generated string. The point is to only set a link as "visited" after it has actually been interacted with.</p>

            <p>The header with a mega-nav dropdown which opens on keyboard focus, a search form, a left side content area… what a headache! If only there were some way to skip all of this repeated content to get to what you actually want; the main content of the page.</p>

It’s purpose is to solve the issues described above; skip over the repeated content areas in order to set keyboard focus onto the main body content. This way, keyboard-only users have a mechanism to go directly to the main content.</p>

            </ul>

          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The other part of creating a skip link is to send keyboard focus to somewhere useful. Remember, the purpose of the link is to skip over repeated content in order to provide quick access to the main content area.</p>
            <p>Typically, when the link is activated, focus will be sent to an element such as the main container or perhaps an article element. These elements do not able to receive keyboard focus by default so in order to accomplish this, the tabindex attribute needs to be added to the element. Specifying a value of -1 will allow the element to receive focus, but will not be available in the tab order when moving around the page content.</p>
            <p>With this in place, activating the skip link will bring keyboard focus from the very top of the document, past all the repeatable content, and directly to the main element. From this point, the user is able to tab forward and consume the primary content of the page.</p>

          <h2>Color contrast</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p><strong>Contrast</strong> is the difference in luminance or colour that makes an object (or its representation in an image or display) distinguishable.</p>
            <p>In other words, how readable is text against its background? If the contrast is low, people will have greater difficulty with reading the text. On the other hand, a higher contrast will allow for easy reading.</p>
            <p>In regards to web accessibility, color contrast is the #1 offender on the web when it comes to accessibility issues. For example, colors like grey on black, light grey on white, etc. These color combinations, as well as a host of others, can be very difficult for some people to perceive.</p>
            <p>In order to be more inclusive with our color choices, let's look at how we can test our colors to make sure they're actually readable.</p>

            <p>When it comes to choosing which colors to use for a design, there is a specific number, or contrast ratio, to reach for. This threshold has been determined by the W3C as a way to ensure people with <strong>low-vision</strong> are able to
              read text content.</p>
            <p>The threshold breakdown is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Text and images of text, which is text content embedded within the image, has a ratio of 4.5 to 1.</li>
              <li>Larger text greater than 18 point has a ratio of 3.0 to 1.</li>
              <li>And non-text content, including input borders and icons, also have a ratio of 3.0 or 1.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As displayed here, the threshold is more forgiving for larger text and non-text content, such as <code>input</code> borders and icons. However, we still need to ensure these elements are also highly visible.</p>
            <p>Now that we know what to watch for and which ratios should be used to test which type of content, how do we actually test the contrast ratio of our colors to ensure readability?</p>

            <p>When it comes to relaying messages to the user, especially something important such as an error or success state of a form, how much time is left to complete an exercise, or sections of a pie chart, it's best to not rely on color alone to convey this information.

            <p>There are different types of <strong>color blindness</strong> and <strong>low-vision</strong> impairments which makes seeing specific colors difficult or impossible. With this in mind, to help convey this important information, it's ideal to include other visual indicators such as:</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>HTML form fields feature an attribute called <code>placeholder</code>. The value of the attribute places text inside the field and when someone starts to type, the placeholder text is automatically removed.</p>
            <p>The original purpose of this attribute is to place helper or hint text inside the <code>input</code>. However, sometimes placeholders are being used in place of an actual HTML <code>label</code> element. This is problematic for a few reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Without a <code>label</code> element associated with the <code>input</code>, some <strong>screen readers</strong> may not be able to convey the purpose of the <code>input</code>.</li>
              <li>When someone starts to type and the placeholder text is removed from view, the context of the <code>input</code> may be lost, forcing someone to remove the entered text in order to remember what the <code>input</code> was for.</li>
              <li>In order to to meet color contrast requirements, the default grey text needs to be darkened. In doing so, this may confuse some people in thinking that text has already been entered into the <code>input</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/">more issues</a> with the <code>placeholder</code> attribute, but with these few in mind it's clear that the placeholder should not be used as a replacement for an actual <code>label</code>.</p>

            <li><span role="img" aria-label="Not so good:">👎</span> Potential for poor implementation</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Give the <a href="https://codepen.io/svinkle/full/NvazGb/">floating label demo</a> a try.</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The "floating label" technique seems to be picking up in popularity as of late. Depending on how it's implemented, the basic idea is to use CSS to position the <code>label</code> (or sometimes the placeholder) text over-top of the related <code>input</code> element. When someone starts typing, the <code>label</code> is "floated" up and placed above the <code>input</code>.</p>
            <p>The benefit to this approach is that it saves space in-between <code>input</code>s when screen real estate is tight. There's also the clear benefit of a <code>label</code> element being associated with its <code>input</code> element for screen readers to convey the purpose of the <code>input</code>.</p>
            <p>The downside to this approach is a direct result of its purpose of being; when the <code>label</code> is floated up above the <code>input</code>, the space available typically only allows for less than ideal text size. This could result in difficulty reading the <code>label</code> for anyone with <strong>low-vision</strong>. Of course, they could just zoom in on the screen, but why require creating more work for our users?</p>
            <p>Then the other concern regards the actual implementation. If the technique ends up using the placeholder attribute instead of an actual <code>label</code>, it would result in issues previously discussed, mainly the lack of conveyed purpose when interacted with a screen reader.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The ideal design of form <code>label</code>s when it comes to accessibility is the "always visible" <code>label</code>. Just as it sounds, this technique features a text <code>label</code> that is always present across the whole experience of filling out the form.</p>
            <p>The benefits of this approach are quite clear:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The text <code>label</code> is in a consistent, predictable position</li>
              <li>The <code>label</code> is always visible, requiring no cognitive load on having to remember the <code>input</code> purpose</li>
              <li>Screen readers will convey the purpose of the <code>input</code> when interacted with</li>
              <li><code>label</code> text is large with ample white space to be readable</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With all this in mind, it's strongly recommended to keep <code>label</code>s visible. Eliminate any guesswork required from your users and allow them to complete the task at hand with ease and confidence.</p>

            <p>The design of form error messaging can be quite delicate. The idea is to bring awareness to the current state of the form without being overwhelming. Unfortunately it's very easy to cause frustration or grief when displaying error states,
              especially for those who aren't so tech savvy and who are already very cautious and on edge from using a computer in the first place.</p>

          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>With this in mind, let's consider a design aesthetic which is informal and does its best to not be overbearing at the same time.</p>
            <p>Three things to look at in this section include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Error text</li>
              <li>Input styles</li>

          <img src="images/error-message-1.png" alt="Screenshot of input field in error state. Arrows point out features of error state which bring in attention.">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Error text is critical when conveying an error state. Without this text, people might not realize that the form is in a state in which it cannot be submitted. Sure, we could change the color of the <code>input</code> element, perhaps alter
              its border or background properties to something recognizable as an error state. However, as we've already seen, relying on color alone to convey meaning is not ideal.</p>
            <p>So, how do we ensure the <code>input</code> error state is properly conveyed? A few things we can do are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Output text which is meaningful and does not overwhelm the user with technical jargon</li> (<strong>cognitive impairment</strong>).
              <li>Display the text below the related <code>input</code> (<strong>low-vision</strong>).</li>
              <li>Ensure text is readable by testing its <strong>color contrast</strong>.</li>
              <li>Optionally include an icon to help bring the users attention to the text.</li>

          <h4>Connecting error text to its input</h4>
          <img src="images/error-message.png" alt="Screenshot of input field in an error state; red border, light red background, red error text with icon below.">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When someone using a screen reader comes in contact with an input in an error state, this information needs to be announced alongside the label content. Otherwise, there’s a good chance the error context could be lost when navigating through a form.</p>
            <p>There are a few ways to accomplish this, but the most robust would be to include the aria-describedby attribute on the input element. Adding this attribute places the error text in the "queue" of announcing the element on keyboard focus. In order to programatically make the connection, the aria-describedby value needs to match the id of the error text container.</p>
            <p>For example, let’s review an input in an error state:</p>
            <p>This input features a label and some error text directly below. However, the text is not included with the announcement of the label. Let’s make the connection using aria-describedby:</p>
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>No connection</h4>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-html">
              &lt;label for="fname"&gt;First name&lt;/label&gt;
              &lt;input type="text"
                id="fname"
                name="fname"&gt;
              &lt;span id="error-fname" class="error"&gt;First name is required&lt;/span&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This input features a label and some error text directly below. However, the text is not included with the announcement of the label as there's no programatic connection being made. Let’s make the connection using aria-describedby:</p>

          <h4>Using <code>aria-describedby</code></h4>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-html">
              &lt;label for="fname"&gt;First name&lt;/label&gt;
              &lt;input type="text"
                id="fname"
                name="fname"
                aria-invalid="true"
                aria-describedby="error-fname"&gt;
              &lt;span id="error-fname" class="error"&gt;First name is required&lt;/span&gt;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>With the aria-describedby attribute, the announcement from a screen reader would sound like, "First name, invalid, edit text. First name is required." One of the benefits of using aria-describedby specifically is that it adds a short pause in between the label text and the error text, giving it a little bit more of a distinction.</p>

          <h4>Error list</h4>
          <img src="images/error-list-1.png" alt="Screenshot of error list. Arrows point out features of error list which bring in attention.">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Presenting an error list is particularly useful on large forms. It's made up of a heading, explaining the current state of the form, followed by a link list.</p>
            <p>The heading, typically an h2, is the primary method of bringing the error state to the users attention. Sighted users will see the large text and non-visual users will have the keyboard focus state, ideally, be brought to this portion of the screen.</p>
            <p>The heading, typically an h2,  is the primary method of bringing the error state to the user’s attention. When the heading is presented to the user, send the focus to the heading element using the JavaScript focus() method as well as applying tabindex="-1" to the heading element in order for it to receive focus.</p>
            <p>The list portion is made up of a ul list element containing links. Each link represents a single error in the form. The link text would match that of the error text output below the related input. When activated, the keyboard focus would switch from the link to the related input, allowing the user to focus and address the issue on hand.</p>
            <p>The ideal positioning of the error list is directly above the form which is for user convenience. For example, if someone using a screen reader were to move forward past the error list, they would be brought to the form and the input elements. Each input would be accompanied by their own error state text which would inform the user on how to adjust the input content to meet its validation requirements. </p>
            <p>The error list, in combination with the error text below the input, ensures the user is notified of the current errors which need attention, and allows the user to not have to remember each error which needs fixing. The message is available when then arrive at the input element.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Proximity issues can arise when interface elements are designed far apart from one another. This mostly affects people with <strong>low-vision</strong> who rely on Zoom software.</p>
            <p>What happens when someone uses Zoom software is that they only see a small fraction of the screen at once. Usually the zoomed portion of the screen follows the current position of the mouse pointer or keyboard cursor.</p>
            <p>As a result of someone only being able to see a small section at a time, oftentimes when attempting to complete a task, content is difficult to find or may be missed entirely.</p>
            <p>How do we test to ensure there are minimal to no proximity issues within our designs? One relatively simple and effective method is to perform what's called, "the straw test."</p>

            <p>How you perform the straw test? Taking one hand and making a fist. Then, you open your fist just enough to let a "straw" through. From this point, hold your fist up to one of your eyes and attempt to view your design.</p>
            <p>When it comes to reviewing a design or reading content on the web, the typical reading flow in North America is top-to-bottom, left-to-right. With this in mind, get your straw tests ready and attempt to fill out this form:</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Was it easy or difficult to accomplish? Did you find yourself going back and forth to make sure the field you were viewing matched up with the <code>label</code> it was intended for? How long did it take you to complete?</p>
            <p>This is a prime example of poor proximity. The form <code>label</code>s are much too far apart from their <code>input</code> elements. The submit <code>button</code> is on the bottom right, which would be much more difficult to locate than
              if it were placed on the other side.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>How was filling out this form compared to the last when testing with the straw test? Much faster and easier to fill out? Less frustrating?</p>
            <p>This demonstrates why, ideally, forms are designed with the form <code>label</code> directly above the form field. This way the form is much easier to consume for people with low-vision who may be using zoom software. It also makes things
              easier for everyone else in the end, as making things accessible often does.</p>
            <p>The main purpose of the straw test is to ensure related elements and content in general is easily found for people with low-vision who rely on zoom software. Even with 20/20 vision, items which are located far apart can be difficult to find.</p>
            <p>Let's make sure the user experience we create is easily discoverable and comfortable for our users. We don't want to make them work any harder than they already need to.</p>

            <p>In the past, if someone with low-vision needed to zoom their browser window in order to better read content, traditionally this would result in the poor experience of 2d scrolling; having to scroll horizontally as well as vertically in order to consume the content. 2d scrolling is not only an irritant for most people, it also introduces a new level of difficulty for anyone with a motor impairment or someone who relies on the keyboard alone to navigate; this requires a shift from using the Tab/Space key to read content vertically, to the arrow keys to read horizontally, and back again.</p>
            <p>Where responsive design plays its role is now when someone zooms their browser to enlarge the content, the layout and styling rules defined within the CSS media queries will load as the zoom level increases. In other words, when content is zoomed the person on the other side of the screen will experience the “mobile” layout eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling, resulting in a much more positive user experience.</p>

            <p>This is due to the inclusion of the viewport meta tag:</p>
            <p>This is telling the browser to set the width of the content to the width of the device itself, and to scale that content to 1 on load.</p>
            <p>If the site layout has been developed with responsive design best practices, this would be enough to remove any 2d scrolling in order to comfortable consume the content.</p>

            <p>Specifically what we're talking about here are UI components such as hamburger menu controls, social media icons, form <code>input</code>s; basically anything that's a stand-alone element on a page., ie, not a an embedded link within body content.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When it comes to ensuring usability and accessibility concerns of touch target size, there are a few thing to keep in mind, including the available size of the element and space in between elements in order to avoid accidentally activating
              something unintended. Here are a few rules to consider from other organizations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/accessibility/accessible-styles">Google's Web Fundamentals</a> guide recommends a touch target size of <strong>48x48 pixels </strong>with at least <strong>8 pixels</strong> in between.</li>
              <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/">Apple's Human Interface Guidelines</a> recommends at touch target size of at least <strong>44x44 pixels</strong>.</li>
              <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#target-size">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> v2.1 also includes the recommendation of a touch target size of 44x44 pixels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>What's important to note here is when it comes to design, making the actual icon larger to satisfy these recommendations isn't required. By using the CSS `padding` property we can make the touch area larger without affecting the design or layout of the content.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Using white space, which is the blank, empty area in between interactive components, is actually quite critical when designing and creating _usable_ user interfaces.</p>
            <p>For example, it's not too uncommon to come across a group of links which are meant to behave as callout actions. Often these will be made up of three or more links in a grid and may feature no whitespace in between. This might provide a certain aesthetic appeal, however when it comes to someone with a **motor impairment**, such as hand tremors where they're unable to control the movements of their own hands, the usability of navigating past these callout links becomes problematic.</p>
            <p>Let's checkout the following video for an example:</p>
            <p>As we've witnessed in this video, the person was having great difficulty when trying to navigate past these large touch target and repeatedly activated the links by accident. This is why it's ideal to place at least 8-10 pixels of whitespace in between interactive elements. Without this white space, it can result in a frustrating user experience.</p>

            <p>As we’ve previously discussed, screen reader users are able to navigate by specific pieces of content. In doing so, folks who rely on this technology are able to find a heading, section, or a specific link quite quickly.</p>
            <p>An issue may arise, however, when links, labels, buttons, etc are not sufficient in conveying their purpose. Their purpose in being should be explained well enough within their accessible name. If the name is not clear or perhaps the same type of element is repeated with the exact same name, this may lead to confusion or frustration for the user.</p>

            <p>There are a couple methods available in order to help provide more context for links like these without disrupting the intended design.</p>
            <p>Of course, adding extra visible text would be ideal as this would benefit people with cognitive impairments with clear labelling or those with low-vision who rely on zoom software. But, if you’re unable to sway things in this direction, let’s look at a couple alternatives.</p>

          <h4>Visually hidden text</h4>

          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The CSS visuallyhidden class definition is a way to visually hide text content from sighted users, yet, have it be available for screen reader users.</p>
            <p>This method was originally created by Jonathan Snook and has since been adopted in the HTML5 Boilerplate project as a default class definition in its CSS offering.</p>
            <p>Coming back to the "Read more" link example, we see here the HTML looks the same as before but with the addition of a new span element. This span features the visuallyhidden class which means the text content within will be hidden from sighted users, preserving the original design, but also provides the extra context needed for screen reader users.</p>
            <p>Now, when someone using a screen reader encounters this link, they would hear, "Read more about How to Make Pasta Sauce."</p>

          <h4>The <code>aria-label</code> approach</h4>

          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Using the aria-label attribute is an alternative to the visuallyhidden CSS method. This approach directly sets the intended hidden content as the accessible name for the element.</p>
            <p>Revisiting the link example from before, this code is a little bit cleaner and easier to read compared to the visuallyhidden example.</p>
            <p>One thing you may have noticed is the repeat content of, "Read more" within the aria-label attribute. This is required in order for a screen reader to announce the text in its entirety.</p>
            <p>As a result of using the aria-label attribute is that the attribute value takes precedence over anything else that’s placed within the link element. In other words, when you apply the aria-label attribute, any text within the element will be completely ignored by screen readers.</p>

            <p>A common pattern for web design these days is to hide primary navigation in an “offscreen drawer”, toggled by a hamburger menu control. This pattern is usually set in place for a small screen or mobile context, though it’s also been seen on desktop sites as well.</p>
            <p>An accessibility issue with this pattern arises when the drawer container is positioned off-screen via CSS position property only. The menu is tucked away visually, however, when someone using a keyboard to navigate Tabs through the page content, these visually “hidden” links will still be focusable, essentially creating hidden tab-stops.

            <p>In order to hide content completely from sighted users, keyboard-only users, and screen reader users, there are a few methods we can take:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Applying CSS display: none to the drawer container will accomplish the desired effect of hiding the content from keyboard users. One note on this solution is that the display property cannot be animated without some extra JavaScript setting the property at a specific time.</li>
              <li>Applying the CSS visibility: hidden property essentially produces a similar result as using display: none. The difference here is the visibility property is much easier to animate, especially when used alongside the opacity CSS property.</li>
              <li>Lastly, applying the HTML hidden attribute to the drawer container would product the same result as the CSS display: none property; hiding the content completely from visual and non-visual users alike.</li>

              to guide the user to a new task which needs attention. Ideally, animations would be useful, predictable, and consistent.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, poor use of animations might be distracting, take the attention away from the current task, and might even leave someone feeling queasy and disoriented.</p>

          <h3>What actually makes up a "poor" animation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Size of movement — Keep animations small and purposeful</li>
            <li>Direction and speed – Allow the user to scroll at their own pace.</li>
            <li>Distance — Refrain from animating long lengths of content</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Everyone will have a different reaction, or perhaps no reaction at all, to a piece of animation. For those who do experience a negative reaction, how to we avoid creating such an experience?</p>
            <p>Here's a few points to consider when creating animations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Size of movement.</strong> Small or compact animations, like a loading spinner, are helpful. However, if there's something moving from one side of the screen to another, especially critical pieces of content, this can be problematic.
                Keep animations small and purposeful.</li>
              <li><strong>Direction and speed.</strong> Parallax effects and scroll jacking, which tend to involve foreground and background elements moving at different speeds, or objects moving in different directions than expected, can cause issues. Allow
                the user to scroll at their own pace.</li>
              <li><strong>Distance.</strong> For animations which seem to span large lengths of space, although only the size of a computer screen, can sometimes trigger a negative experience. Again, it's best to keep animations small and compact in order
                to avoid a negative user experience. Refrain from animating long lengths of content.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Animation is something that can unexpected, and when it's there, we typically don't have a whole lot of control over the experience. How can we ensure when animation is in use that we also create an accessible experience?</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>One tool in the developer toolbox we can utilize is the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> CSS media query. In order give the choice of experiencing animations for our users, both macOS and iOS feature a setting to remove animation altogether called Reduce motion.</p>
            <p>When this setting is enabled within the operating system settings, code within the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query will fire, allowing developers to essentially create a "no animation" state.</p>

              a:focus, a:hover {

              @media (prefers-reduced-motion) {

          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When we want to remove or disable a piece of animation in a website, we can add the CSS to a <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query.</p>
            <p>For example, if there was a <code>transition</code> set on all <code>a</code> elements to animate the color on <code>hover</code> and <code>focus</code>, the CSS might look like: <em>(what's on the screen)</em></p>
            <p>And if, for example, the end user didn't want to wait the <code>.25</code> seconds for the transition to complete for some reason, we could provide a "no animation" state by utilizing the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query:</p>
            <p>And that's it! By including this bit of CSS, any <code>transition</code> animations set on the <code>a</code> selector will be removed when the user has selected the Reduce motion option in their operating system settings.</p>
            <p>As of this writing only Safari and Firefox support this media query with other browsers and operating systems trailing behind.</p>
            <p>By using the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, we're allowing our users to remove all animations which they may find distracting or jarring. Remember, the key here is to provide a usable and comfortable user experience in order for people to enjoy, return to, and share the content we create.</p>

            <p>ARIA is essentially a set of specific HTML attributes which get applied to various elements. For example, when a screen reader user comes in contact with an element featuring one or many of these attributes, the screen reader software will recognize the supplied attributes and their values and announce this information out loud.</p>
            <p>Let’s take a peek at a few of the attributes available.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The role attribute is used to add or alter the base semantic meaning of an element.</li>
              <li>aria-label is used to add an accessible name to an element.</li>
              <li>aria-disabled would announce the element as in a "disabled" state — the same outcome as using the "disabled" HTML attribute.</li>

            <p>It’s important to note what ARIA does (above) and what it doesn’t do.</p>
            <p>When you apply ARIA attributes, roles, and state properties to an HTML element, this does not automatically allow the element to be keyboard focusable.</p>
            <p>ARIA also does not add all the expected keyboard interactivity. These are things that you, as the developer, need to implement yourself.</p>
            <p>For example, with the "fake button" on the previous slide and all the attributes that were added, this would announce the element as a "button", but this will not make the <code>div</code> focusable nor will it provide the expected keyboard interaction via <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> keys.

              <li>The div with class="checkbox__checkbox" would represent the checkbox visual, typically with an SVG icon or CSS</li>
              <li>This div also features role="checkbox". This is the attribute required for screen readers to announce this component as a "checkbox." Without it, it would appear as a generic container.</li>
              <li>The div features the tabindex attribute with its value set to 0. This allows non focusable elements to receive keyboard focus when the user Tabs to the element.</li>
              <li>The aria-checked attribute is present which conveys the current state of the checkbox. When interacted with, this value would need to toggle from false to true.</li>
              <li>Finally, the div has the aria-labelledby attribute with its value set to the id of the element which holds the text label. When this div receives keyboard focus, the aria-labelledby attribute will make the connection with the element which matches its value and add the matching element’s content to the announcement of the checkbox on focus.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As you may be able to tell, using the ARIA method is quite a bit more code to write and maintain. This is only the HTML needed to create the ARIA version of a checkbox. There’s also the CSS code to visually style the checkbox as well as the JavaScript to handle the Space keypress event and toggle the aria-checked value.</p>
            <p>For this reason, it’s recommended to use native HTML elements. This way there’s less code to write and maintain, as well as the built-in keyboard support and semantic meaning that comes with each native element.</p>

            <p>ARIA can also be used to create common "desktop" interface patterns that are non-native on the web or in the browser. These patterns are well documented on their implementation and expected interactions in the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices guide.</p>
            <p>For example, complex desktop applications may feature a tree view or a tab interface as a means to navigate the content within the app. There is no "tree" or "tab" element available within HTML. Therefore, if your web app design calls for such a component, one can be created and implemented using a combination of HTML and ARIA to convey the meaning and purpose of the pattern, and then add CSS and JavaScript to apply the necessary styling and functionality.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>One other unique feature that ARIA adds is the ability to create a live region. With a live region, you’re able to send an audible message out to screen reader users, when appropriate, in order to inform them of a change in state upon interaction or a timed message.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>When sending or deleting an email from a list, it would be ideal to let the user know when the message was either sent or removed from their inbox</li>
              <li>When adding an item to a cart, make the user aware of the successful addition</li>
              <li>If someone has a limited amount of time to complete a task, announce the amount of time remaining in semi-regular intervals</li>
              <li>If an app is currently in a loading state displaying a loading animation, make screen reader users aware of this context as well</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The purpose of a live region is to help provide an equal user experience for those who are unable to see the user interfaces we create and make sure they're made aware of the current context.</p>

            <p>For dynamic content and non-native components, such as date pickers, modal windows, autocomplete fields, extra care needs to be taken in order to ensure an accessible user experience.</p>
            <p>As we’ve previously discussed, ARIA can be used to help convey meaning and set expectations when interacting with highly dynamic components. It acts as a bridge between non-native HTML elements and assistive technologies by generating semantic meaning for custom components.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>We have available to us an official W3 guide to help in this very situation: WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices.</p>
            <p>The ARIA Authoring Practices guide is broken down into various components. Each component specifies how to apply ARIA attributes, how someone might use a keyboard to interact with the component, and sometimes provides fully working examples.</p>
            <p>So, let's go through and review the best practices when creating a modal window component.</p>

          <h3>Modal window</h3>
          <img src="images/modal-window.gif" width="650" heght="380" alt="Animated GIF of a modal window being activated and appearing into view.">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>A modal window is a common component used in order to bring the user’s attention to something important. It’s often represented visually with a small portion of content right in the middle of the screen with the rest of the page content "below" or "behind" the modal content with a darkened overlay. Essentially this visual representation states to the user, "Put whatever it was you were doing on hold as this content is really important. Please provide your full attention on me for now."</p>
            <p>When it comes to interacting with a modal window, someone using a mouse can either dismiss the window by clicking the close button, clicking a call-to-action button (usually "Ok" or "Cancel"), or sometimes the darkened overlay itself can be interacted with to dismiss.</p>
            <p>However, when it comes to someone using just the keyboard, how can we ensure the expected interactions are available to successfully navigate a modal window? What are the expected interactions? How do we convey the information needed to inform a screen reader user, someone who may not be able to see the modal window visual, of the current context they’re interacting with?</p>
            <p>Let’s look through the Authoring Practices guide on creating a modal window; the expected keyboard interaction, managing focus, and adding the appropriate ARIA attributes.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Focus management is a method used to willfully and purposefully move the keyboard cursor from one element to another on behalf of the user. This technique is sometimes required to guide the user with the intended flow of the app. Focus management should only be used when absolutely necessary as to not create more work for the user when an unexpected shift in focus has occurred. (When to shift focus is pointed out in the ARIA best practices guide.)</p>
            <p>Let’s review the required focus management for an accessible modal window component.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>When the user activates the launcher control (typically a button element but could also be an link depending on the context), the keyboard focus will shift from the control to the modal window container.</li>
              <li>As pointed out in the previous section, keyboard focus should remain within the modal window when using Tab, Shift + Tab or the screen reader virtual cursor to navigate.</li>
              <li>When the modal window is dismissed, focus should return to the control which launched the window. This way, the user can carry on with their task right where they left off.</li>

          <h4>Keyboard trap?</h4>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So far we’ve established some of the requirements for the modal window; ARIA attributes, focus management, and the expected keyboard interactions. One other important piece is enforcing or "trapping" the keyboard cursor to the modal window itself. How do we accomplish this? </p>
            <p>This used to be quite a complex task to write in JavaScript; selecting all focusable elements within the modal, tracking the visible state, ensuring the last item receives focus if the first is tabbed past, and more. Thankfully, modern development practices and advancements in HTML are happening to help make this pattern much easier to write.</p>

          <h4>The <code>inert</code> attribute</h4>
          <dl>
            <dt>Definition</dt>
            <dd>When a node is <strong>inert</strong>, the user agent must act as if the node was absent for the purposes of targeting user interaction events, may ignore the node for the purposes of text search, and may prevent the user from selecting text in that node.</dd>
            <dt>Polyfill</dt>
            <dd><a href="https://github.com/WICG/inert">github.com/WICG/inert</a></dd>
          </dl>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>To handle trapping the keyboard we can use the inert attribute. When the inert attribute is applied to a container, all child elements that are naturally keyboard focusable are removed from the natural tab order. In other words, they are no longer focusable. In a way it’s almost the same as if applying CSS display: none to the container, except the content is still visible in a "read-only" state.</p>
            <p>Since the inert attribute is not officially part of the HTML specification, we can use the WICG inert polyfill for the time being. This polyfill is being actively worked on and has a solid support behind it. Eventually, this attribute will be a part of the HTML spec and will be included in browsers for general use.</p>

          <h4>Using <code>inert</code></h4>

            <code class="language-html">
              &lt;header inert&gt;
                &lt;!-- … --&gt;
              &lt;/header&gt;

              &lt;main inert&gt;
                &lt;!-- … --&gt;
              &lt;/main&gt;

              &lt;footer inert&gt;
                &lt;!-- … --&gt;
              &lt;/footer&gt;

              &lt;div class="modal" …&gt;
                &lt;!-- … --&gt;

            </code>
          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Apply the inert attribute to content containers other than the modal window as we still need to make sure our users can interact with that content. That said, it's best to generate the modal window HTML container as a sibling to all other containers on the page. This way you can apply the inert attribute to those elements and skip past the modal window itself.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Tooltips are one of those patterns that seems simple enough to implement, yet making them work well lots of different people is not such an easy task.</p>
            <p>The idea is to provide extra detail or context on something that needs extra information. The tooltip content is typically hidden behind an "information" icon and is displayed on mouse over. When the user moves the mouse away, the content is hidden again.</p>
            <p>Weather or not the tooltip is needed is another discussion, but if one shows up in a design, it’s best to know how to implement one that is accessible for all.</p>
            <p>Like the modal window component, the details for creating an accessible tooltip are outlined on the Authoring Practices guide. Unfortunately, it’s clear that this component has not been fully flushed out and is lacking a clear example.</p>

            <p>Focus management is minimal compared to the requirements of a modal window. In fact, there’s no focus management required at all!</p>
            <p>Let’s review the expected interaction when using a keyboard to read and consume tooltip content.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Keyboard focus is received by the tooltip "launcher" control (typically a button element represented with an icon.)</li>
              <li>On click, the tooltip content is made available to consume and focus remains on the button element (this is an expected outcome when interacting with an element with "button" role/semantics.)</li>
              <li>When keyboard focus moves away from the tooltip launcher, the tooltip content is hidden from view.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Again, pretty light requirements compared to a modal window. Let's checkout out the ARIA requirements.</p>

            <p>Since the requirements for when someone using a screen reader encounters a tooltip are still sparse, it may not be overly clear what the user is interacting with. Here’s what the ARIA Authoring Practices guide states, along with a few extra recommendations.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>On the launcher control, add aria-label — This will add an accessible name to the control, something like "More information" will suffice</li>
              <li>On the launcher control, add aria-describedby and set its value to the id of the tooltip content — This will announce the tooltip content on control focus</li>
              <li>On the launcher control, add aria-controls and set its value to the id of the tooltip content — This will inform assistive technology of the relationship between the control and the tooltip content</li>
              <li>On the launcher control, add aria-pressed = false — This adds additional context of if the control has been activated or not — toggle to <code>true</code> when tooltip is displayed</li>
              <li>The tooltip content container should have role="tooltip" — This conveys the presence of tooltip content to assistive technology</li>
